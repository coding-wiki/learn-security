Learn practises to help you achieve better security.

## Philosophy
To start of, there is no such thing as a secure system. Security is relative, you need to be one step ahead of an attacker. The fabric of low-level architecture â€“ binary and assembly give you full privileges from the start. Operating systems have permission models; however, these are complex systems which will always have vulnerabilities without some kind of break through.
